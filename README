Sledgehammer Solutions Limited

For more information on SSL's work on the TEMPer1 devices on OS X
and Linux visit http://ssl-lab.blogspot.com/

This version is a basic utility that supports a single connected
TEMPer1 USB device. 

Features to be added:
- Unit selection
- Spool of logged temperature and time
- Timed triggering of readings
- Calibration settings and calculation

Desirable, but not immediately planned:
- Support multiple connected devices
